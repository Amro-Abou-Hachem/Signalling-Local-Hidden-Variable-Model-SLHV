# Signaling Local Hidden Variable Model

We provide an implementation of the linear porgram that caclculates the ** white noise visibility**  


We provide an implementation of the linear program and its dual to calculate the white-noise visibility of bipartite probability distributions
in the context of a signalling local hidden variable (SLHV) model.
